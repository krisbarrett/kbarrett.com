<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
I am an enthusiastic engineer interested in web development, mobile app development, and embedded systems. I am passionate about creating products and services that enrich people's lives. I studied electrical engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where I received my bachelors degree in 2009. For the first four years of my career, I worked in the communications equipment industry developing software, testing systems, and sustaining hardware projects. I started an online business called Crispytronics selling breakout boards for electronics projects. Most recently, I have created a web application called MusLessons which will be used to provide online music lessons. I am currently seeking contracting and full-time employment opportunities in the greater San Diego area.
