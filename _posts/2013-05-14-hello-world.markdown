Welcome to my simple web blog.  It is powered by a tool called [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) which generates static websites.  These static websites can be hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) for little to no cost.  I am typing this blog post in a lightweight markup language called [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) will convert into a static HTML page.  The obvious disadvantage is that there is no admin interface or rich text editor, just text and some command line tools.  Those of us who are more productive in the command line might actually call this an advantage.  The power of the tool lies in the fact that pages are rendered once: no server side processing or database connections slowing things down.

I hope to use this blog to write more about programming and electronics.  I also have a WordPress blog, which you can find [here](http://www.krisbarrett.com).  If I decide that I like [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), I will migrate my old blog posts over.  I also plan to add a comment system using [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com).  Thanks for reading.
